<p>Books have undergone tremendous transformations throughout history. Their evolution reflects innovations in technology, culture, and society.</p>
<br>
			
<h4>A. Evolution of Books</h4>
<p>The earliest form of books can be traced back to ancient civilizations where texts were inscribed on tablets made of clay, wood, or stone. As civilizations progressed, the invention of parchment and the codex‚Äîan early version of the modern book‚Äîrevolutionized the way information was recorded and shared. With the rise of the Renaissance, books gained even more prominence, leading to the age of vast literary output and exploration of ideas, thanks to the dedication and intellect of scholars and writers.</p>
<br>
			
<h4>B. Impact of Printing Press on Books</h4>
<p>The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century marked a turning point in the history of books. With its ability to mass-produce texts, the printing press made books accessible to the general public, transforming the landscape of literacy and education. It allowed for the circulation of literature, scientific texts, and cultural narratives on an unprecedented scale. As a result, the ideas of the Enlightenment, Modernism, and many subsequent movements were disseminated widely, influencing society at large.</p>

<br>
			
<h4>C. Reference Books</h4>

<br>

<p>Self-help books focus on personal development, offering advice, techniques, and insights into improving oneself. They cover various topics, from mental health and relationships to career growth, appealing to those seeking change and empowerment in their lives.</p>
