		<p class="text_1">If you're new to Trinity or want to brush up on existing skills, join us this year for a series of introductory sessions delivered by the Staff of the Library, and <b>Student Learning Development.</b><br>

         Do you want to know more about writing and research skills to help with your projects and dissertations? Sessions will appear in a calendar below as they are announced.<br>

         We look forward to seeing you!<br>
